<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Effective Date: 12 January 2026</p>


<p>Welcome to Phorcysty, an AI-powered media processing application operated by lakyyyyyyy kak. Phorcysty is designed to help users apply advanced color transfer and color style transformation to their images and videos using pre-trained artificial intelligence models.</p>


<p>Our application focuses specifically on AI-based color transfer across different types of media. The main features include:</p>

<p></p>
Image-to-Image color transfer

Video-to-Video color transfer

Image-to-Video color style transfer

Video-to-Image color style transfer
</p>

<p>These features allow users to apply the color style of one image or video to another while preserving the original structure and content of the media.</p>

<p>In addition to color transfer, Phorcysty provides professional adjustment tools that let users fine-tune their media, including:</p>

<p>
Contrast

Brightness

Saturation

Hue

Temperature

Tint
</p>

<p>To deliver these functionalities, Phorcysty uses multiple trusted pre-trained AI models that process media efficiently and securely. We do not sell, rent, or misuse your personal data. Our primary goal is to provide high-quality color transformation and enhancement tools for creative and professional use.</p>
